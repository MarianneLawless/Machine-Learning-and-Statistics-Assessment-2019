# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Assessment-2019

This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices [1] dataset and the
Python [3] packages scipy [2], keras [7], and jupyter [6]. The project is worth 100%
of your marks for this module, but it is broken into three parts, as follows.

## Housing market data to measure the willingness to pay for clean air.

(20%) Describe: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer
to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within
the repository, create a jupyter [6] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and
plots to describe the Boston House Prices [1] dataset. This part is worth 20% of
your overall mark.

(20%) Infer: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential
statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices
between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. You should
explain and discuss your findings within the notebook. This part is also worth
20%.

(60%) Predict: Again using the same notebook, use keras [7] to create a neural network
that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.


Libraries Used

    numpy - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things; a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
    
    Pandas - an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
    
    Matplotlib - is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
    
    Seaborn - is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
    
    scikit-learn - is a software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
    
    SciPy - is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. This project specifically uses the scipy.stats module which contains a large number of probability distributions as well as a growing library of statistical functions.
    
    StatsModels - is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.
    
    Keras - Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It’s used for building deep learning models.
